# iterated-minimal

This is a sample experiment using magpie.

First, set up the project with `npm install`

To run the project locally, run `npm run serve`

To build the project for deployment (e.g. to Netlify), run `npm run build`

If you are hosting this repository on github, the project will automatically be built and deployed to the gh-pages branch, so you only have to enable Github Pages in your repository settings to publish your project.

For more information, see the [manual](https://magpie-mnual.netlify.app/).

To automatically fix coding style and format the code (linting) run `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:style`
